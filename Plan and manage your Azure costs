Plan and manage your Azure costs
Compare costs by using the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator –
What's the TCO Calculator? –
The TCO Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on Azure over time, instead of in your on-premises datacenter.
The term total cost of ownership is commonly used in finance. It can be hard to see all the hidden costs related to operating a technology capability on-premises. Software licenses and hardware are additional costs.
With the TCO Calculator, you enter the details of your on-premises workloads. Then you review the suggested industry average cost (which you can adjust) for related operational costs. These costs include electricity, network maintenance, and IT labor. You're then presented with a side-by-side report. Using the report, you can compare those costs with the same workloads running on Azure. You don't need an Azure subscription to work with the TCO Calculator.
How does the TCO Calculator work? –
Working with the TCO Calculator involves three steps:
•	Define your workloads: First, you enter the specifications of your on-premises infrastructure into the TCO Calculator, based on these four categories –
	Servers: This category includes operating systems, virtualization methods, CPU cores, and memory (RAM).
	Databases: This category includes database types, server hardware, and the Azure service you want to use, which includes the expected maximum concurrent user sign-ins.
	Storage: This category includes storage type and capacity, which includes any backup or archive storage.
	Networking: This category includes the amount of network bandwidth you currently consume in your on-premises environment.
•	Adjust assumptions: Next, you specify whether your current on-premises licenses are enrolled for Software Assurance, which can save you money by reusing those licenses on Azure. You also specify whether you need to replicate your storage to another Azure region for greater redundancy.
Then, you can see the key operating cost assumptions across several different areas, which vary among teams and organizations. These costs have been certified by Nucleus Research, an independent research company. For example, these costs include:
	Electricity price per kilowatt hour (KWh).
	Hourly pay rate for IT administration.
	Network maintenance cost as a percentage of network hardware and software costs.
To improve the accuracy of the TCO Calculator results, you adjust the values so that they match the costs of your current on-premises infrastructure.
•	View the report: Choose a time frame between one and five years. the TCO Calculator generates a report that's based on the information you've entered. For each category (compute, datacenter, networking, storage, and IT labor), you can also view a side-by-side comparison of the cost breakdown of operating those workloads on-premises versus operating them on Azure. You can download, share, or save this report to review later.
Purchase Azure services –
What types of Azure subscriptions can I use? –
You probably know that an Azure subscription provides you with access to Azure resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and databases. The types of resources you use impact your monthly bill. Azure offers both free and paid subscription options to fit your needs and requirements. They are:
•	Free trial: A free trial subscription provides you with 12 months of popular free services, a credit to explore any Azure service for 30 days, and more than 25 services that are always free. Your Azure services are disabled when the trial ends or when your credit expires for paid products unless you upgrade to a paid subscription.
•	Pay-as-you-go: A pay-as-you-go subscription enables you to pay for what you use by attaching a credit or debit card to your account. Organizations can apply for volume discounts and prepaid invoicing.
•	Member offers: Your existing membership to certain Microsoft products and services might provide you with credits for your Azure account and reduced rates on Azure services. For example, member offers are available to Visual Studio subscribers, Microsoft Partner Network members, Microsoft for Startups members, and Microsoft Imagine members.
How do I purchase Azure services? –
There are three main ways to purchase services on Azure. They are:
•	Through an Enterprise Agreement: Larger customers, known as enterprise customers, can sign an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft. This agreement commits them to spending a predetermined amount on Azure services over a period of three years. The service fee is typically paid annually. As an Enterprise Agreement customer, you'll receive the best customized pricing based on the kinds and amounts of services you plan on using.
•	Directly from the web: Here, you purchase Azure services directly from the Azure portal website and pay standard prices. You're billed monthly, as a credit card payment or through an invoice. This purchasing method is known as Web Direct.
•	Through a Cloud Solution Provider: A Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) is a Microsoft Partner who helps you build solutions on top of Azure. Your CSP bills you for your Azure usage at a price they determine. They also answer your support questions and escalate them to Microsoft, as needed.
You can bring up, or provision, Azure resources from the Azure portal or from the command line. The Azure portal arranges products and services by category. You select the services that fit your needs. Your account is billed according to Azure's "pay for what you use" model.
At the end of each month, you're billed for what you've used. At any time, you can check the cost management and billing page in the Azure portal to get a summary of your current usage and review invoices from prior months.
What factors affect cost? –
The way you use resources, your subscription type, and pricing from third-party vendors are common factors. Let's take a quick look at each –
•	Resource type: A number of factors influence the cost of Azure resources. They depend on the type of resource or how you customize it. For example, with a storage account you specify a type (such as block blob storage or table storage), a performance tier (standard or premium), and an access tier (hot, cool, or archive). These selections present different costs.
•	Usage meters: When you provision a resource, Azure creates meters to track usage of that resource. Azure uses these meters to generate a usage record that's later used to help calculate your bill. Think of usage meters similar to how you use electricity or water in your home. You might pay a base price each month for electricity or water service, but your final bill is based on the total amount that you consumed.
Let's look at a single VM as an example. The following kinds of meters are relevant to tracking its usage:
	Overall CPU time.
	Time spent with a public IP address.
	Incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) network traffic in and out of the VM.
	Disk size and amount of disk read and disk write operations.
Each meter tracks a specific type of usage. For example, a meter might track bandwidth usage (ingress or egress network traffic in bits per second), number of operations, or its size (storage capacity in bytes).
The usage that a meter tracks correlates to a quantity of billable units. Those units are charged to your account for each billing period. The rate per billable unit depends on the resource type you're using.
•	Resource usage: In Azure, you're always charged based on what you use. As an example, let's look at how this billing applies to deallocating a VM. In Azure, you can delete or deallocate a VM. Deleting a VM means that you no longer need it. The VM is removed from your subscription, and then it's prepared for another customer.
Deallocating a VM means that the VM is no longer running. But the associated hard disks and data are still kept in Azure. The VM isn't assigned to a CPU or network in Azure's datacenter, so it doesn't generate the costs associated with compute time or the VM's IP address. Because the disks and data are still stored, and the resource is present in your Azure subscription, you're still billed for disk storage.
Deallocating a VM when you don't plan on using it for some time is just one way to minimize costs. For example, you might deallocate the VMs you use for testing purposes on weekends when your testing team isn't using them. You'll learn more about ways to minimize cost later in this module.
•	Azure subscription types: Some Azure subscription types also include usage allowances, which affect costs.
•	Azure Marketplace: You can also purchase Azure-based solutions and services from third-party vendors through Azure Marketplace. Examples include managed network firewall appliances or connectors to third-party backup services. Billing structures are set by the vendor.
Does location or network traffic affect cost? –
When you provision a resource in Azure, you need to define the location (known as the Azure region) of where it will be deployed. Let's see why this decision can have cost consequences.
•	Location: Azure infrastructure is distributed globally, which enables you to deploy your services centrally or provision your services closest to where your customers use them. Different regions can have different associated prices. Because geographic regions can impact where your network traffic flows, network traffic is a cost influence to consider as well.
•	Zones for billing of network traffic: Billing zones are a factor in determining the cost of some Azure services. Bandwidth refers to data moving in and out of Azure datacenters. Some inbound data transfers (data going into Azure datacenters) are free. For outbound data transfers (data leaving Azure datacenters), data transfer pricing is based on zones. A zone is a geographical grouping of Azure regions for billing purposes. The following zones include some of the regions as shown here:
	Zone 1: Australia Central, West US, East US, Canada West, West Europe, France Central, and others
	Zone 2: Australia East, Japan West, Central India, Korea South, and others
	Zone 3: Brazil South, South Africa North, South Africa West, UAE Central, UAE North
	DE Zone 1: Germany Central, Germany Northeast
How can I estimate the total cost? –
An accurate cost estimate takes all of the preceding factors into account. Fortunately, the Azure Pricing calculator helps you with that process.
The Pricing calculator displays Azure products in categories. You add these categories to your estimate and configure according to your specific requirements. You then receive a consolidated estimated price, with a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each resource you added to your solution. You can export or share that estimate or save it for later. You can load a saved estimate and modify it to match updated requirements.
You also can access pricing details, product details, and documentation for each product from within the Pricing calculator.
The options that you can configure in the Pricing calculator vary between products, but they can include:
•	Region: A region is the geographical location in which you can provision a service. Southeast Asia, Central Canada, Western United States, and Northern Europe are a few examples.
•	Tier: Tiers, such as the Free tier or Basic tier, have different levels of availability or performance and different associated costs.
•	Billing options: Billing options highlight the different ways you can pay for a service. Options can vary based on your customer type and subscription type and can include options to save costs.
•	Support options: These options enable you to select additional support pricing options for certain services.
•	Programs and offers: Your customer or subscription type might enable you to choose from specific licensing programs or other offers.
•	Azure Dev/Test pricing: This option lists the available prices for development and test workloads. Dev/Test pricing applies when you run resources within an Azure subscription that's based on a Dev/Test offer.
Keep in mind that the Pricing calculator provides estimates and not actual price quotes. Actual prices can vary depending upon the date of purchase, the payment currency you're using, and the type of Azure customer you are.
Manage and minimize total cost on Azure –
Here are some recommended practices that can help you minimize your costs –
•	Understand estimated costs before you deploy: To help you plan your solution on Azure, carefully consider the products, services, and resources you need. Read the relevant documentation to understand how each of your choices is metered and billed. Calculate your projected costs by using the Pricing calculator and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator. Only add the products, services, and resources that you need for your solution.
•	Use Azure Advisor to monitor your usage: Ideally, you want your provisioned resources to match your actual usage. Azure Advisor identifies unused or underutilized resources and recommends unused resources that you can remove. This information helps you configure your resources to match your actual workload.
Recommendations are sorted by impact: high, medium, or low. In some cases, Azure Advisor can automatically remediate, or fix, the underlying problem. Other issues, such as the two that are listed as high impact, require human intervention.
•	Use spending limits to restrict your spending: If you have a free trial or a credit-based Azure subscription, you can use spending limits to prevent accidental overrun. If you have a credit-based subscription and you reach your configured spending limit, Azure suspends your subscription until a new billing period begins.
A related concept is quotas, or limits on the number of similar resources you can provision within your subscription. For example, you can allocate up to 25,000 VMs per region. These limits mainly help Microsoft plan its datacenter capacity.
•	Use Azure Reservations to prepay: Azure Reservations offers discounted prices on certain Azure services. Azure Reservations can save you up to 72 percent as compared to pay-as-you-go prices. To receive a discount, you reserve services and resources by paying in advance. For example, you can prepay for one year or three years of use of VMs, database compute capacity, database throughput, and other Azure resources.
Azure Reservations are available to customers with an Enterprise Agreement, Cloud Solution Providers, and pay-as-you-go subscriptions.
•	Choose low-cost locations and regions: The cost of Azure products, services, and resources can vary across locations and regions. If possible, you should use them in those locations and regions where they cost less.
But remember, some resources are metered and billed according to how much outgoing (egress) network bandwidth they consume. You should provision connected resources that are metered by bandwidth in the same Azure region to reduce egress traffic between them.
•	Research available cost-saving offers: Keep up to date with the latest Azure customer and subscription offers, and switch to offers that provide the greatest cost-saving benefit.
•	Use Azure Cost Management + Billing to control spending: Azure Cost Management + Billing is a free service that helps you understand your Azure bill, manage your account and subscriptions, monitor and control Azure spending, and optimize resource use. Azure Cost Management + Billing features include:
	Reporting: Use historical data to generate reports and forecast future usage and expenditure.
	Data enrichment: Improve accountability by categorizing resources with tags that correspond to real-world business and organizational units.
	Budgets: Create and manage cost and usage budgets by monitoring resource demand trends, consumption rates, and cost patterns.
	Alerting: Get alerts based on your cost and usage budgets.
	Recommendations: Receive recommendations to eliminate idle resources and to optimize the Azure resources you provision.
•	Apply tags to identify cost owners: Tags help you manage costs associated with the different groups of Azure products and resources. You can apply tags to groups of Azure resources to organize billing data. Tags make it easier to identify groups that generate the biggest Azure costs, which can help you adjust your spending accordingly.
•	Resize underutilized virtual machines: A common recommendation that you'll find from Azure Cost Management + Billing and Azure Advisor is to resize or shut down VMs that are underutilized or idle. Keep in mind that resizing a VM requires it to be stopped, resized, and then restarted. This process might take a few minutes depending on how significant the size change is. Be sure to properly plan for an outage or shift your traffic to another instance while you perform resize operations.
•	Deallocate virtual machines during off hours: Recall that to deallocate a VM means to no longer run the VM but preserve the associated hard disks and data in Azure.
If you have VM workloads that are only used during certain periods, but you're running them every hour of every day, you're wasting money. These VMs are great candidates to shut down when not in use and start back when you need them, saving you compute costs while the VM is deallocated.
This approach is an excellent strategy for development and testing environments, where the VMs are needed only during business hours. Azure even provides a way to automatically start and stop your VMs on a schedule.
•	Delete unused resources: This recommendation might sound obvious, but if you aren't using a resource, you should shut it down. It's not uncommon to find nonproduction or proof-of-concept systems that are no longer needed following the completion of a project.
Regularly review your environment, and work to identify these systems. Shutting down these systems can have a dual benefit by saving you on infrastructure costs and potential savings on licensing and operating costs.
•	Migrate from IaaS to PaaS services: As you move your workloads to the cloud, a natural evolution is to start with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) services because they map more directly to concepts and operations, you're already familiar with.
Over time, one way to reduce costs is to gradually move IaaS workloads to run on platform as a service (PaaS) services. While you can think of IaaS as direct access to compute infrastructure, PaaS provides ready-made development and deployment environments that are managed for you.
•	Save on licensing costs: Licensing is another area that can dramatically impact your cloud spending –
	Choose cost-effective operating systems
	Use Azure Hybrid Benefit to repurpose software licenses on Azure
