Introduction to Azure fundamentals
Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services range from simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud to running fully virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like AI and Internet of Things (IoT).
Cloud Computing –
Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
•	Lower your operating costs.
•	Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
•	Scale as your business needs change.
To power your services and deliver innovative and novel user experiences more quickly, the cloud provides on-demand access to:
•	A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components.
•	Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.
•	Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.

•	Trust your cloud: Get security from the ground up, backed by a team of experts, and proactive compliance trusted by enterprises, governments, and startups.
Azure Portal –
The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can:
•	Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
•	Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
•	Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.
The Azure portal is designed for resiliency and continuous availability. It maintains a presence in every Azure datacenter. This configuration makes the Azure portal resilient to individual datacenter failures and avoids network slowdowns by being close to users. The Azure portal updates continuously and requires no downtime for maintenance activities.
Azure Marketplace –
Azure Marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure.
The solution catalog spans several industry categories such as open-source container platforms, virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment software, developer tools, threat detection, and blockchain. Using Azure Marketplace, you can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and reliably, hosted in your own Azure environment.

What resources do virtual machines use?: The many VMs that use its resources are guest machines, guest computers, guest operating systems, or simply guests. The hypervisor treats compute resources—like CPU, memory, and storage—as a pool of resources that can easily be relocated between existing guests or to new virtual
Azure Fundamental Concepts
Types of Cloud Models –
There are three deployment models for cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.
•	Public cloud: Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet.
	No capital expenditures to scale up.
	Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
	Organizations pay only for what they use.
•	Private cloud: A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.
	Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
	Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
	Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.
•	Hybrid cloud: A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
	Provides the most flexibility.
	Organizations determine where to run their applications.
	Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.
Cloud Computing Advantages –
There are several advantages that a cloud environment has over a physical environment –
•	High availability: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
•	Scalability: Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:
	Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
	Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.
•	Elasticity: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.
•	Agility: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.
•	Geo-distribution: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.
•	Disaster recovery: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.
•	Reliability = High Availability: Server uptime is really one of the biggest concerns for any data center. If the system goes down, that could cost the company thousands or even millions of dollars. Many on-premises systems appear to have virtually 100% uptime since they are “always” up. However, running 24/7 servers for 8-to-5 workloads are simply wasteful, and yet, these systems periodically experience downtime, upgrade, or maintenance issues. On the contrary, most cloud services within Microsoft Azure come with a 99.95% SLA guarantee which is much higher than most on-premises data centers can hope to offer.
The architect of the cloud is built on the premise that hardware will fail at some point. Cloud providers like Microsoft or Amazon have automated a number of features that used to cause headache when hosting on-premises servers:
1.	•3 redundant copies of data at all times, with 1 copy in a separate data center in case of regional disaster like a hurricane or earthquake;
2.	•Automatic fail over to backup server to minimize downtime;
3.	•Hosting applications on at least 2 server instances to minimize downtime when hardware failure occurs;

Therefore, unless you want to spend millions of dollars on building and maintaining your own IT infrastructure, it is highly unlikely that you can compete with the stability and reliability of public cloud providers.
•	Predictability: Cloud computing is typically provided on a monthly pay-as-you-go financing model. 
1.	the cost of IT operations can now be aligned with the business growth instead of requiring large capital expenses up front in anticipation of new businesses, customers, or applications.
2.	 CIOs can now know exactly how much IT operational costs are associated with an addition of one customer or a unit of service. 
3.	The cloud allows for “just in time” delivery of needed services with very little advanced notice of seasonal or temporary spikes in demand.
4.	 predict trends and challenges before they happen using monitoring tools and predictive analytics which help your internal IT personnel troubleshoot potential bottlenecks and plan for additional capacity if need to. 
5.	proactively resolve issues with real-time data, alerts, and technical support from the cloud providers.
Capital expenses vs. operating expenses –
There are two different types of expenses that you should consider:
•	Capital Expenditure (CapEx) is the up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up-front expense over time. The up-front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.
•	Operational Expenditure (OpEx) is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up-front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.
Cloud computing is a consumption-based model –
Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for. A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:
•	No upfront costs.
•	No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
•	The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
•	The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
